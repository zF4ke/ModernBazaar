# Modern Bazaar

[![CI](https://github.com/zF4ke/ModernBazaar/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/zF4ke/ModernBazaar/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
<!--![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/zF4ke/ModernBazaar)-->

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Work in progress.

A personal attempt to build a modular, enterprise‚Äëgrade bazaar market analyzer for Hypixel SkyBlock.  
Java/Spring Boot core, TypeScript NextJS dashboard, Dockerized infra (PostgreSQL, Prometheus, Grafana).  
Real-time bazaar analytics with comprehensive trading data and strategies; ML-driven forecasting and anomaly detection later.

## üí° Vision 
A cleanly separated system:
- Core backend that fetches, monitors, stores, and serves market data via a stable API.
- Empirical data analysis for different trading strategies.
- Dashboard as the primary user interface.
- Optional Python/Java modules for heavier analysis or ML.
- Production-style observability and reliability

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap
I'll try to keep this updated as I make progress, but it will not be exhaustive (especially around the specific trading strategies I want to implement).

- [x] Core project scaffolded (Gradle, Dockerfile, Spring profiles)
- [x] Infra stack (Postgres, Prometheus, Grafana) running with basic metrics
- [x] GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for building, testing, and deploying

**Core API & persistence**
- [x] Background job: poll Hypixel ‚Üí `BazaarItemSnapshot`
- [x] Skip duplicate snapshots
- [x] Swagger UI & OpenAPI (`/swagger-ui.html`, `/v3/api-docs`)
- [x] `GET /api/bazaar/items` & `GET /api/bazaar/items/{productId}` (now live snapshot + HourSummary)
- [x] Pagination, filtering, error handling
- [x] Skyblock Items API + catalog refresh endpoints
- [x] `GET /api/bazaar/items/{productId}/history?from=&to=&withPoints=` (hour summaries)
- [ ] **(obsolete)** minute-level snapshots endpoint ‚Äî replaced by history above

**Web Dashboard (Next.js + TypeScript)**
- [x] Basic dashboard structure with navigation
- [x] Bazaar Items page with pagination, filtering, composite live view
- [x] Skyblock Items page with filtering
- [x] Settings page with system status and data management
- [x] Multi-metric ECharts implementation (Price, Orders, Delta, Volume)
- [x] Interactive time-range controls (1H, 6H, 24H, 7D, Total)
- [x] Responsive layout, tooltips, zoom/pan, smooth animations
- [ ] Advanced filtering and search features

**Trading Strategies & Analysis**
- [ ] `GET /api/rankings/top-[spread|volume|volatility|profit|custom-score]`
- [ ] Additional strategy endpoints & UI
- [ ] Replace prior bot interactions with API-powered UI
- [ ] (Optional) Auth + subscription support
- [ ] Trade journal storage

**Retention & pruning**
- [x] **Hourly compaction**  
  ‚Ä¢ raw snapshots ‚ûú HourSummary + kept HourPoints  
  ‚Ä¢ deletes heavy snapshots once processed
- [ ] Nightly job: thin/archive old HourPoints (e.g., keep 7 days, then downsample)
- [ ] Optional S3 export for long-term history
- [ ] Cold-snapshot archive to reduce DB footprint

**Other**
- [ ] Recording rules, alerts, refined Grafana dashboards
- [ ] Cache hot reads & optimize background jobs
- [ ] ML modules (prediction, anomaly detection) tied into Core
- [ ] Scale/shard where necessary

## ‚ö° Quick start
