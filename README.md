- logarithmic quantity penalty (favors manageable quantities)
- proven track record for practical trading scenarios

**delta score**: advanced margin-focused algorithm with mathematical sophistication:
- enhanced margin weighting with square root amplification
- smooth liquidity curves using hyperbolic tangent
- sigmoid efficiency bonuses for optimal quantity management
- sophisticated mathematical caps instead of hard filters

### `/help`
shows what each command does

## pricing strategies

- **buy orders â†’ sell orders** - place buy orders for ingredients, sell orders for results (most profit)
- **buy orders â†’ instant sell** - place buy orders for ingredients, instant sell results
- **instant buy â†’ sell orders** - instant buy ingredients, sell orders for results  
- **instant buy â†’ instant sell** - instant buy ingredients, instant sell results (fastest)
