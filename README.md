# Modern Bazaar

[![CI](https://github.com/zF4ke/ModernBazaar/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/zF4ke/ModernBazaar/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
<!--![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/zF4ke/ModernBazaar)-->

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Work in progress.

A personal attempt to build a modular, enterprise‚Äëgrade bazaar market analyzer for Hypixel SkyBlock.  
Java/Spring Boot core, TypeScript NextJS dashboard, Dockerized infra (PostgreSQL, Prometheus, Grafana).  
Real-time bazaar analytics with comprehensive trading data and strategies; ML-driven forecasting and anomaly detection later.

## üí° Vision 
A cleanly separated system:
- Core backend that fetches, monitors, stores, and serves market data via a stable API.
- Empirical data analysis for different trading strategies.
- Dashboard as the primary user interface.
- Optional Python/Java modules for heavier analysis or ML.
- Production-style observability and reliability

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap
I'll try to keep this updated as I make progress, but it will not be exhaustive (especially around the specific trading strategies I want to implement).

- [x] Core project scaffolded (Gradle, Dockerfile, Spring profiles)
- [x] Infra stack (Postgres, Prometheus, Grafana) running with basic metrics
- [x] Github Actions CI/CD pipeline for building, testing, and deploying
- [ ] **Core API & persistence**
  - [x] Implement background job to fetch Hypixel's API and save `BazaarItem` + `BazaarProductSnapshot`
  - [x] Only persist snapshots if data has changed (skip duplicates)  
  - [x] Swagger UI & OpenAPI (`/swagger-ui.html`, `/v3/api-docs`)
  - [x] `GET /api/bazaar/items` & `GET /api/bazaar/items/{productId}` (ItemsController + DTOs)
  - [x] Add ~~paging~~ (in the future if needed), filtering and error handling to each endpoint
  - [ ] Implement `GET /api/bazaar/items/{productId}/snapshots?from={timestamp}&to={timestamp}` endpoint
- [ ] Implement `GET /api/rankings/top-[spread|volume|volatility|profit|custom-score]` endpoints
  - [ ] Implement other endpoints for trading strategies and analysis
  - [ ] Find a way to keep track of my trades and store them
  - [ ] **Retention & pruning**  
    - [ ] Schedule nightly analysis job to aggregate/prune old `BazaarProductSnapshot` records (e.g. keep hourly snapshots, drop minute‚Äëlevel)  
    - [ ] Archive or delete stale snapshot data to reduce DB footprint  
- [ ] Build web dashboard to explore trends, prices, and strategies
  - [ ] Replace prior bot interactions with API-powered UI
  - [ ] (Optional) Add authentication and subscription support
- [ ] Add recording rules, alerts, and refined dashboards in Grafana
- [ ] Optimize background jobs & introduce caching for high‚Äëfrequency updates
- [ ] Introduce ML modules (prediction, anomaly detection) and tie them into Core
- [ ] Scale/shard where necessary
